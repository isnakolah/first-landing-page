    <p class="intro">Ever wondered what makes a person happy, my guess is satisfaction. Thats why most people are very happy after a good meal. In my quest for true happyness I found myself intrested in coding. Trust me, this is among the most fulfilling things in my life. This is not a hobby, this is a lifestyle. My question to you today is, <span class="important">why are you doing what you are doing? </span> </p>
    <p>My programming skills are under development at Moringa School. I was enrolled at the <abbr title="Moringa Prep Full Time 16th Cohort " class="abbr">MPFT16</abbr> where I have met one of the most interesting people in my life. Their learning model is a most surprising one i have ever experienced. In Moringa they use a peer programming model thereby enhancing the learning curve </p> <hr>
